I attended GopherCon India 2016 out of curiosity and I have plans
to catch up on Go programming language in this year.

I would need more time to go through Go and write some program using it. So, I wrote the code
in Ruby. Even though problem description stressed on Go (for GopherCon India attendees),
I hope you are looking for logic more than the language syntax.

Files
*****

* inputs/cities.csv - Your original file
* inputs/distributors.txt - input file with the rules for distributors. City, Province, Country
names should match the text in cities.csv and they must hyphen separated as described in the
problem description. Associated codes are not used. Input  is not case sensitive.
* inputs/test_cases.txt - some sample test cases to verify the program. Even though I'm familiar
with testing frameworks, I didn't use any testing framework. I tried to keep things very simple.
main.rb will automatically feed the lines in this file and print the results.

Usage
*****

$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p643 (2015-02-25 revision 49749) [x86_64-darwin14.1.0]

$ ruby main.rb
Loading Repo... Done
19 Test Cases. 19 Passed. 0 Failed.

Assumptions
***********

Input, test cases are in valid format as described in problem description / as seen in
included files.

Thanks!
