To compile:
  Goto parent dir and run go build. This will generate executables(Eg: challenge2016)

How to run this script:
  ./challenge2016 <path to the rule file> <distrubutor> <locationcode to query>

  eg: ./challenge2016 ./distributors.rule DISTRIBUTOR2 BENGU-KA-IN

  If distributors is allowed to operate on a given location this script will return YES. otherwise NO.

Note:
- File cities.csv is used to validate the input. So this file has to be in the same dir where the executable is present.
- In the distributors rule file, I have used code. So when you construct rule, please use code.
- in the rule file multiple hierarchy is not needed. eg d2 is sub-customer d1 and d3 is sub-customer of d2 we can achive this by just
adding one level hierarchy.

    Permissions: d1
    Permissions: d2 < d1
    Permissions: d3 < d2

- Rules are case sensitive.
