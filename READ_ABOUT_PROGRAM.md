The Program Takes Input n from the User and creates n distributors and assigns permissions randomly to distributor 1 inside INDIA, where as distributor 1 is head and all commes in downstream . 
so, distributor i permissions are subset of distributor i-1 permissions which are assigned randomly
After that it will take input q which is number of queries and the input will be taken in the form of ----> (distributor1-exclude-bangalore-karnataka-india) and the program will say whether the query is true or
false or the city does not fall under this distributor



NOTE :- 

while Taking input fmt.Scanln will sometimes throws an error, please try again :)


Thanks & Regards,
Ramesh Malli.
